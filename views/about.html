<p> This is just a little demo project that I did. I wanted to try some things in AngularJS and was also interested in getting some data for various D20-based roleplaying games. <br> Maybe someone besides me can use it. If not, so be it. I learned a lot writing it and had fun playing around with the numbers. </p>
