Damage Per Round Calculator (for d20 based roleplaying games). This is an old project/experiment I did a while ago. Since it still works and might be useful, I thought I'd share the source. It was originally written for d&d 3.5e and calculates a comparable value to determine how much damage per round different attacks of a roleplaying character or monster can do.

You can still use it at: [https://noinfo.github.io/dpr](https://noinfo.github.io/dpr)
